# Final-Year-College-Project
       The Moving Object Detection and Tracking project was developed during the senior year of university as part of the Final Year Project, using Python, OpenCV, MobileNetSSD, and other relevant technologies. MobileNetSSD is an efficient object detection model that computes object category and bounding box accurately from input images. The project report is attached for review purposes.
