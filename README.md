# Final-Year-College-Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Moving Object Detection and Tracking project was developed during the senior year of university as part of the Final Year Project, using Python, OpenCV, MobileNetSSD, and other relevant technologies. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MobileNetSSD is an efficient object detection model that computes both: 
- bounding box  
- object category

accurately from input images. 
The project report is attached for review purposes.
